## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ritesh22201/melodious-rabbit3105.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd melodious-rabbit3105`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Install backend dependencies: `cd back-end && npm install`
5. Create a MongoDB database and update the configuration in `back-end/.configs/db.js`

## Usage

1. Start the backend server: `cd back-end && npm run server`
2. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides RESTful APIs for managing tasks and communicates with the MongoDB database.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js, Redux.js, and TypeScript, offering an intuitive user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

## API Documentation

- `GET /todo/`: Get a list of all tasks.
- `POST /todo/addTodo`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /todo/update/:id`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /todo/delete/:id`: Delete a task.
- `PATCH /todo/update/:id`: Mark a task as complete.

## Database Schema

The MongoDB database schema consists of a `todos` collection with fields like `title`, `description`, `completed`, etc.

## Configuration

Confuguration is set up in MongoDB, by setting up the environment variables in .env file and setting up the database connection in `.configs/db.js`

## Deployment

For deployment, Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend. Updated environment variables accordingly.
